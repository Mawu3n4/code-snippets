Language rule


Always use semicolons.

```javascript
//NO
MyClass.prototype.myMethod = function() {
  return 42;
} //semicolon missing here

//YES
MyClass.prototype.myMethod = function() {
  return 42;
};

//NO
function foo() {

};
```

Prefer the use of `===` over `==`

Prefer the use of `!==` over `!=`

Always declare variable with the keyword `var`

Always use exceptions where needed and do not exit function without proper control of the workflow

Avoid using the delete keyword and prefer assigning `null` to the variable, unless removing the variable from and object's iterated list of keys is needed

Do not use `for ... in` loops to iterate over an Array, only use for iterating over keys in an object/map/hash

Use string concatenation instead of escaping the end of the line for multi-line string literals

Always use the keyword `this` when accessing an object's properties within its scope

Style rules

Naming

Names should be short and explicit.

Never use `$` or `\` in names

Name should only be composed of letters and `_`

Do not use `_` as the first or last character of a name.

Always use `snake_case` for variable names

Always use `camelCase` for function names

Always use `UpperCamelCase` for object names

Global varaibles should be in all caps

Optional function arguments start with `opt_`

Parenthesis and braces

Always use parenthesis around `return` statements.

Always add a whitespace before the parenthesis after a keyword

Opening curly brace should be on the same line as the statement

//NO
while (True)
{
 ..
}

//YES
while (True) {
  ...
  }
  
Whitespaces

Do not mix tabs and spaces for indenting

Do not use tabs for indenting

The indentation unit is 4 spaces

Remove trailing whitespaces

Comments

Comment blocks should look like
/*
** This is a comment
** that goes on
** several lines
*/

Inline comments must be before the line it is commenting and should look like

//YES
//this is a comment about the if statement
if (foo == 'bar') {
 ....
 }
 
 //NO
 if (food == 'bar') {  //this is a comment about the if statement
  ...
  }
  
Always comment functions and code snippets

Avoid adding unecessary comments

//NO
//set i to 0
var i = 0;

Lines should be 80 col long at most
